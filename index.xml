      <title>Dark Artifacts: Lessons Learned from the Field</title>

      <description>In the last few months, I’ve had the privilege—and the challenge—of working with some of the most dangerous relics documented to date. These objects, steeped in curses, represent millennia of arcane history, yet we’re only beginning to understand the depth of their power and risks.&#xA;One critical lesson is that stability can hinge on even the smallest factors: a slight increase in ambient magical energy can activate curses unexpectedly. My team’s newest containment protocol, which we developed based on recent artifact failures, emphasizes double-enchantment barriers, an innovation that we hope will prevent further &amp;lsquo;field surprises.</description>

      <title>The Ethical Summoner: Navigating Responsibility in Dark Arts</title>
      <link>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/posts/the-ethical-summoner/</link>

      <description>Working in summoning and conjuration often feels like walking a razor&amp;rsquo;s edge. The thrill of channeling powerful, ancient forces is undeniable, but so too is the responsibility that comes with it. In my recent research on conjured entities, I’ve realized that ethical practices must adapt to the changing landscape of dark arts. This isn’t about wielding power but about understanding its true scope and ramifications.&#xA;One area I’m currently focused on is the balance between control and autonomy when dealing with conjured beings.</description>

      <title>Hex Transference: Ancient Techniques, Modern Challenges</title>
      <link>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/posts/hex-transference/</link>

      <description>In the world of dark arts, curse transference remains one of the most elusive and complex phenomena to master. Recently, I’ve been revisiting some ancient techniques from the Grimoire of Ebon Shadows, and while many of these methods seem arcane and outdated, they carry a wisdom that our modern techniques sometimes lack. However, adapting these rituals for current use is a task riddled with hurdles—primarily the unpredictability of hex potency when transferred across different mediums.</description>

      <title>Relic Ethics: Where Do We Draw the Line?</title>
      <link>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/posts/relic-ethics/</link>

      <description>The allure of cursed artifacts is undeniable—each relic carries a unique energy, a story etched in dark enchantments. But as I’ve delved deeper into artifact containment research, one question repeatedly haunts my mind: Are there some relics too dangerous to keep, even in the name of knowledge?&#xA;I recently examined a hex-bound relic known as the Veilstone Chalice, a cup steeped in a curse that seems to drain vitality from anything nearby.</description>

      <title>Artifact Enchantment and Hex Containment: Innovations in Dark Relic Handling</title>
      <link>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/artifact-enhantment-and-hex-containment/</link>

      <guid>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/artifact-enhantment-and-hex-containment/</guid>
      <description>This project centers on the development of containment methods for volatile, high-risk enchanted artifacts. Evander’s work in this area examines the stability of cursed and hex-bound relics, seeking safer ways to transport, store, and neutralize these objects. Through his innovative artifact containment spells and barrier enchantments, Evander has contributed to improved standards in relic handling across arcane institutions. His research also explores how the enchantments on dark relics interact with external magical energies, influencing their stability and curse potency.</description>

      <title>Interdimensional Entities and Conjuration Protocols: Ethical Control and Containment of Dark Summons</title>
      <link>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/interdimensional-entities-and-conjuration-protocols/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/interdimensional-entities-and-conjuration-protocols/</guid>
      <description>This project focuses on the summoning, control, and containment of interdimensional entities, a highly challenging area within dark arts that involves conjuring beings from other realms. Evander&amp;rsquo;s work addresses the ethical concerns surrounding these practices, as well as the potential dangers associated with unstable conjurations. Through rigorous fieldwork and experimental summoning, he has developed protocols for safer conjuration environments and containment fields that protect practitioners and surrounding spaces. This research also examines the potential beneficial uses of conjured entities in protective and restorative capacities, challenging the traditional view of such beings as purely malevolent.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Forbidden Rites: Structural Analysis and Ethical Applications of High-Level Curse Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/the-dynamics-of-forbidden-rites/</link>

      <guid>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/the-dynamics-of-forbidden-rites/</guid>
      <description>Evander Grimveil’s research project on the Dynamics of Forbidden Rites seeks to unravel the intricate workings of high-level curses, exploring both their structure and ethical applications. This study dives into the mechanics of advanced hexes, investigating how they can be modified for purposes beyond their traditional use, such as protection or healing. His research involves hands-on experimentation with ancient curse artifacts, careful dissections of curse transference patterns, and the development of counter-curse methodologies.</description>
