  <p>This project centers on the development of containment methods for volatile, high-risk enchanted artifacts. Evander’s work in this area examines the stability of cursed and hex-bound relics, seeking safer ways to transport, store, and neutralize these objects. Through his innovative artifact containment spells and barrier enchantments, Evander has contributed to improved standards in relic handling across arcane institutions. His research also explores how the enchantments on dark relics interact with external magical energies, influencing their stability and curse potency.</p>
