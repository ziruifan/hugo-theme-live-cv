      <guid>https://ziruifan.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/artifact-enhantment-and-hex-containment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project centers on the development of containment methods for volatile, high-risk enchanted artifacts. Evander’s work in this area examines the stability of cursed and hex-bound relics, seeking safer ways to transport, store, and neutralize these objects. Through his innovative artifact containment spells and barrier enchantments, Evander has contributed to improved standards in relic handling across arcane institutions. His research also explores how the enchantments on dark relics interact with external magical energies, influencing their stability and curse potency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Interdimensional Entities and Conjuration Protocols: Ethical Control and Containment of Dark Summons</title>

      <guid>https://ziruifan.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/interdimensional-entities-and-conjuration-protocols/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project focuses on the summoning, control, and containment of interdimensional entities, a highly challenging area within dark arts that involves conjuring beings from other realms. Evander&amp;rsquo;s work addresses the ethical concerns surrounding these practices, as well as the potential dangers associated with unstable conjurations. Through rigorous fieldwork and experimental summoning, he has developed protocols for safer conjuration environments and containment fields that protect practitioners and surrounding spaces. This research also examines the potential beneficial uses of conjured entities in protective and restorative capacities, challenging the traditional view of such beings as purely malevolent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Forbidden Rites: Structural Analysis and Ethical Applications of High-Level Curse Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://ziruifan.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/the-dynamics-of-forbidden-rites/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Evander Grimveil’s research project on the Dynamics of Forbidden Rites seeks to unravel the intricate workings of high-level curses, exploring both their structure and ethical applications. This study dives into the mechanics of advanced hexes, investigating how they can be modified for purposes beyond their traditional use, such as protection or healing. His research involves hands-on experimentation with ancient curse artifacts, careful dissections of curse transference patterns, and the development of counter-curse methodologies. By analyzing these curses in a controlled setting, Evander aims to create safe frameworks for the practical deployment of dark magic under ethical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
