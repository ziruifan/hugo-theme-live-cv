  <p>Evander Grimveil’s research project on the Dynamics of Forbidden Rites seeks to unravel the intricate workings of high-level curses, exploring both their structure and ethical applications. This study dives into the mechanics of advanced hexes, investigating how they can be modified for purposes beyond their traditional use, such as protection or healing. His research involves hands-on experimentation with ancient curse artifacts, careful dissections of curse transference patterns, and the development of counter-curse methodologies. By analyzing these curses in a controlled setting, Evander aims to create safe frameworks for the practical deployment of dark magic under ethical guidelines.</p>
