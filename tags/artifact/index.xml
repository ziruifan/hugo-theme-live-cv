      <title>Dark Artifacts: Lessons Learned from the Field</title>

      <description>In the last few months, I’ve had the privilege—and the challenge—of working with some of the most dangerous relics documented to date. These objects, steeped in curses, represent millennia of arcane history, yet we’re only beginning to understand the depth of their power and risks.&#xA;One critical lesson is that stability can hinge on even the smallest factors: a slight increase in ambient magical energy can activate curses unexpectedly. My team’s newest containment protocol, which we developed based on recent artifact failures, emphasizes double-enchantment barriers, an innovation that we hope will prevent further &amp;lsquo;field surprises.</description>

      <title>Relic Ethics: Where Do We Draw the Line?</title>

      <description>The allure of cursed artifacts is undeniable—each relic carries a unique energy, a story etched in dark enchantments. But as I’ve delved deeper into artifact containment research, one question repeatedly haunts my mind: Are there some relics too dangerous to keep, even in the name of knowledge?&#xA;I recently examined a hex-bound relic known as the Veilstone Chalice, a cup steeped in a curse that seems to drain vitality from anything nearby.</description>

      <title>Artifact Enchantment and Hex Containment: Innovations in Dark Relic Handling</title>
      <link>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/artifact-enhantment-and-hex-containment/</link>

      <description>This project centers on the development of containment methods for volatile, high-risk enchanted artifacts. Evander’s work in this area examines the stability of cursed and hex-bound relics, seeking safer ways to transport, store, and neutralize these objects. Through his innovative artifact containment spells and barrier enchantments, Evander has contributed to improved standards in relic handling across arcane institutions. His research also explores how the enchantments on dark relics interact with external magical energies, influencing their stability and curse potency.</description>
