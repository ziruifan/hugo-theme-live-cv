      <title>Dark Artifacts: Lessons Learned from the Field</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, I’ve had the privilege—and the challenge—of working with some of the most dangerous relics documented to date. These objects, steeped in curses, represent millennia of arcane history, yet we’re only beginning to understand the depth of their power and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One critical lesson is that stability can hinge on even the smallest factors: a slight increase in ambient magical energy can activate curses unexpectedly. My team’s newest containment protocol, which we developed based on recent artifact failures, emphasizes double-enchantment barriers, an innovation that we hope will prevent further &amp;lsquo;field surprises.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Ethical Summoner: Navigating Responsibility in Dark Arts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working in summoning and conjuration often feels like walking a razor&amp;rsquo;s edge. The thrill of channeling powerful, ancient forces is undeniable, but so too is the responsibility that comes with it. In my recent research on conjured entities, I’ve realized that ethical practices must adapt to the changing landscape of dark arts. This isn’t about wielding power but about understanding its true scope and ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One area I’m currently focused on is the balance between control and autonomy when dealing with conjured beings. Traditional containment spells often impose harsh restrictions on entities, sometimes sparking unpredictable reactions. My team and I are developing &amp;lsquo;sympathetic conjurations,&amp;rsquo; which allow for a respectful balance of autonomy, mitigating the risk of volatility while maintaining control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Relic Ethics: Where Do We Draw the Line?</title>
      <link>https://ziruifan.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/posts/relic-ethics/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The allure of cursed artifacts is undeniable—each relic carries a unique energy, a story etched in dark enchantments. But as I’ve delved deeper into artifact containment research, one question repeatedly haunts my mind: Are there some relics too dangerous to keep, even in the name of knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently examined a hex-bound relic known as the Veilstone Chalice, a cup steeped in a curse that seems to drain vitality from anything nearby. Containing it required an immense, double-layered protection protocol, and even then, it showed an unpredictable resonance with nearby magic. This raises a crucial ethical dilemma: At what point does the risk to practitioners, even to bystanders, outweigh the benefits of studying such objects?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
