      <description>Working in summoning and conjuration often feels like walking a razor&amp;rsquo;s edge. The thrill of channeling powerful, ancient forces is undeniable, but so too is the responsibility that comes with it. In my recent research on conjured entities, I’ve realized that ethical practices must adapt to the changing landscape of dark arts. This isn’t about wielding power but about understanding its true scope and ramifications.&#xA;One area I’m currently focused on is the balance between control and autonomy when dealing with conjured beings.</description>

      <title>Relic Ethics: Where Do We Draw the Line?</title>

      <description>The allure of cursed artifacts is undeniable—each relic carries a unique energy, a story etched in dark enchantments. But as I’ve delved deeper into artifact containment research, one question repeatedly haunts my mind: Are there some relics too dangerous to keep, even in the name of knowledge?&#xA;I recently examined a hex-bound relic known as the Veilstone Chalice, a cup steeped in a curse that seems to drain vitality from anything nearby.</description>

      <title>Interdimensional Entities and Conjuration Protocols: Ethical Control and Containment of Dark Summons</title>
      <link>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/interdimensional-entities-and-conjuration-protocols/</link>

      <guid>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/interdimensional-entities-and-conjuration-protocols/</guid>
      <description>This project focuses on the summoning, control, and containment of interdimensional entities, a highly challenging area within dark arts that involves conjuring beings from other realms. Evander&amp;rsquo;s work addresses the ethical concerns surrounding these practices, as well as the potential dangers associated with unstable conjurations. Through rigorous fieldwork and experimental summoning, he has developed protocols for safer conjuration environments and containment fields that protect practitioners and surrounding spaces. This research also examines the potential beneficial uses of conjured entities in protective and restorative capacities, challenging the traditional view of such beings as purely malevolent.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Forbidden Rites: Structural Analysis and Ethical Applications of High-Level Curse Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://clusravin.github.io/hugo-theme-live-cv/projects/the-dynamics-of-forbidden-rites/</link>

      <description>Evander Grimveil’s research project on the Dynamics of Forbidden Rites seeks to unravel the intricate workings of high-level curses, exploring both their structure and ethical applications. This study dives into the mechanics of advanced hexes, investigating how they can be modified for purposes beyond their traditional use, such as protection or healing. His research involves hands-on experimentation with ancient curse artifacts, careful dissections of curse transference patterns, and the development of counter-curse methodologies.</description>
